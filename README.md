# MediatR.AspNetCore.CodeGenerator

> This project is just a showcase on how it's possible to generate API Controllers from MediatR requests.
> Since C# Source Generators currently only support .NET Standard 2.0 (because of Visual Studio) they put a lot of limitations,
> so doing it in another process gives us more power.
